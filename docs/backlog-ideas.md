- Every hill
- Sort by any field
- Filter by any field

## Location-based queries and data

- Nearby hills to a hill, given a distance
- Nearby hills, given an arbitrary location (name/coordinate) and a distance
- Include distance, bearing, and relative height on child/parent/nearby relations

## External references (links)

## Additional data sources

## User data
