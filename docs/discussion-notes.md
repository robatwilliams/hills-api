# Discussion notes

- What it is and does - show a query in playground
- Why I made it - change from frontend, interest in hill walking, database of hills is just a static distribution
- I'll focus on AWS not GraphQL here
- Endpoints - graphql, schema, playground
- Whiteboard
  - API gateway (proxy integration)
  - Lambdas (graphql one is the only important one)
  - Aurora Serverless (with Data API)
- Serverless framework to deploy
  - via CloudFormation, makes it pretty easy especially to get started then branch out into other bits as you learn
  - did not inspire much confidence for use in a real app - missing functionality, bugs, needing 3rd party plugins
  - separate stacks: database + everything else
- Lambdas
  - run lambdas locally with serverless-offline, but use real db on AWS
  - no problems with slow start
- Aurora Serverless
  - why not DynamoDB
  - why not RDS
  - slow startup - "leaky serverless"; scaling to zero isn't the selling point though
  - what Data API is & what for - scaling (no persistent connections from many lambdas), no need to put lambdas in VPC
 - GraphQL
   - using `express-graphql`, not Apollo; no need for it
   - but doesn't really need a "server" at all if there was a pure library available
   - `aws-serverless-express`
