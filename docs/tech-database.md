# Database choice

Started off with DynamoDB, then moved to Aurora Serverless.

## DynamoDB

NoSQL key-value store. It was quick and easy to get started with for a personal/concept project with a small amount of data. However, it wasn't suitable by nature for queries other than individual record lookups by key. A relational database would be more suitable.

It can peform queries with non-trivial criteria, but they require an inefficient full table scan. For single-field criteria on fields of type string/number/binary, Global Secondary Indexes solve it. For multi-field criteria, concatenated attributes used as keys (yuck) will work - but only for equality criteria. So it can't do a "query" such as `country == 'Scotland' && height >= 800` - but it can apply such criteria as a post-read filter to the result of a scan... which doesn't really help.

### Cost of full table scan

Storage size of an item is the sum of the size of its attributes' names and values (the former making up a large share here). Storage size of the table is the sum of that for all items, a full table scan needs to read all of that. A scan using eventual consistency (which is half-cost) reads 8 KB per read request unit (RRU) consumed (2 \* 4 KB).

No free tier for on-demand mode, \$0.297 per million RRUs in London.

| Scenario     | Items  | Fields | Item size | Table size | Scan RRUs | Cost of 1K Scans |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 20 Sep 2019  | 924    | 8      | 117 B     | 106 KB     | 14        | \$0.04           |
| Full dataset | 20,000 | 40     | 585 B (?) | 11.2 MB    | 1,428     | \$0.42           |

The first (current) scenario's calculation confirms the value returned by `scan()` when using the `ReturnConsumedCapacity` option.

### Conclusion

The scans are fast enough (50-100ms) in the first (current) scenario, but would probably be quite a bit slower with 100x the table size. That's an issue, even if we could get away with the costs until/if traffic grows. Better switch to Aurora while there isn't much code to adapt.

## Aurora Serverless

Relational DB using MySQL or PostgreSQL. There are no instances to manage; it can scale up/down to meet workload, and can auto-pause during periods of inactivity.

### Costs

Costs in Ireland region:

- \$0.07 per Aurora Capacity Unit (ACU) hour
- \$0.11 per GB-month storage
- \$0.22 per million I/O requests

One ACU has approximately 2 GB of memory with corresponding CPU and networking.

Monthly cost of one full-time ACU would be \$50, compared to \$32 for a non-serverless instance of similar capacity. The key benefit for me with this application however is auto-pausing, which makes that cost a maximum (with auto-scaling disabled) rather than a guaranteed fixed. It would only be realised if the API was incredibly popular, or some nefarious person periodically calls it to prevent auto-sleep (at which point I have disable unauthenticated access).

### Benefits for different use cases

Auto-sleep isn't something you'd enable on an important web API due to the slow resumption time (30-60 seconds); for web APIs the real benefits are auto-scaling and no instances to manage. Auto-pause is more a benefit for infrequently-used databases.

### Data API

The [Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) allows the database to accessed without a persistent connection, making it suitable for short-lived consumers such as lambdas. It also removes the need for a Virtual Private Cloud for the lambdas, eliminating overhead and configuration hassle.

It's currently only available in some regions. It can be enabled via the console/CLI; CloudFormation doesn't currently support doing so.
